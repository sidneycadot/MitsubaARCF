        8.10.4. Simple volumetric path tracer (volpath_simple)

            Parameter                  Type                Description

            maxDepth                   integer             Specifies the longest path depth in the generated output
                                                            image (where -1 corresponds to ∞). A value of 1 will only
                                                            render directly visible light sources. 2 will lead to single-
                                                            bounce (direct-only) illumination, and so on.
                                                            (Default: -1)
            rrDepth                    integer             Specifies the minimum path depth, after which the imple-
                                                            mentation will start to use the “russian roulette” path
                                                            termination criterion.
                                                            (Default: 5)
            strictNormals              boolean             Be strict about potential inconsistencies involving shading
                                                            normals? See page 154 for details.
                                                            (Default: no, i.e. false)
            hideEmitters               boolean             Hide directly visible emitters? See page 149 for details.
                                                            (Default: no, i.e. false)

        This plugin provides a basic volumetric path tracer that can be used to compute approximate solu-
        tions of the radiative transfer equation. This particular integrator is named “simple” because it does
        not make use of multiple importance sampling. This results in a potentially faster execution time.
        On the other hand, it also means that this plugin will likely not perform well when given a scene
        that contains highly glossy materials. In this case, please use volpath or one of the bidirectional
        techniques.
        This integrator has special support for index-matched transmission events (i.e. surface scattering
        events that do not change the direction of light). As a consequence, participating media enclosed by
        a stencil shape (see Section 8.1 for details) are rendered considerably more efficiently when this shape
        has no (footnote) BSDF assigned to it (as compared to, say, a dielectric or roughdielectric BSDF).

        Remarks:

            * This integrator performs poorly when rendering participating media that have a different index of
                refraction compared to the surrounding medium.
            * This integrator has difficulties rendering scenes that contain relatively glossy materials (volpath
                is preferable in this case).
            * This integrator has poor convergence properties when rendering caustics and similar effects. In
                this case, bdpt or one of the photon mappers may be preferable.

        (footnote)

            this is what signals to Mitsuba that the boundary is index-matched and does not interact with light in any way. Alter-
            natively, the mask and thindielectric BSDF can be used to specify index-matched boundaries that involve some
            amount of interaction.
