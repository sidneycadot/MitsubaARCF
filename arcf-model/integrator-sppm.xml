        8.10.9. Stochastic progressive photon mapping integrator (sppm)

        Parameter               Type                Description
        maxDepth                integer             Specifies the longest path depth in the generated output im-
                                                    age (where -1 corresponds to ∞). A value of 1 will only
                                                    render directly visible light sources. 2 will lead to single-
                                                    bounce (direct-only) illumination, and so on. (Default: -1)
        photonCount             integer             Number of photons to be shot per iteration
                                                    (Default: 250000)
        initialRadius           float               Initial radius of gather points in world space units.
                                                    (Default: 0, i.e. decide automatically)
        alpha                   float               Radius reduction parameter alpha from the paper
                                                    (Default: 0.7)
        granularity             integer             Granularity of photon tracing work units for the purpose of
                                                    parallelization (in # of shot particles)
                                                    (Default: 0, i.e. decide automatically)
        rrDepth                 integer             Specifies the minimum path depth, after which the imple-
                                                    mentation will start to use the “russian roulette” path termi-
                                                    nation criterion.
                                                    (Default: 5)
        maxPasses               integer             Maximum number of passes to render (where -1 corre-
                                                    sponds to rendering until stopped manually).
                                                    (Default: -1)

        This plugin implements stochastic progressive photon mapping by Hachisuka et al. [13]. This
        algorithm is an extension of progressive photon mapping (ppm) that improves convergence when
        rendering scenes involving depth-of-field, motion blur, and glossy reflections.
        Note that the implementation of sppm in Mitsuba ignores the sampler configuration—hence, the
        usual steps of choosing a sample generator and a desired number of samples per pixel are not nec-
        essary. As with ppm, once started, the rendering process continues indefinitely until it is manually
        stopped.

        Remarks:
            • Due to the data dependencies of this algorithm, the parallelization is limited to to the local machine
                (i.e. cluster-wide renderings are not implemented)
            • This integrator does not handle participating media
            • This integrator does not currently work with subsurface scattering models.
