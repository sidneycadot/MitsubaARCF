We must add three plugins to Mitsuba to use it for ARCF simulations:

* arcf_source.cpp

  An 'emitter' plugin that casts rays perpendicular to the surface to which it is attached.

* arcf_aperture.cpp

  A 'texture' plugin that distinguishes a region with a square, circular, or rounded-square shape.

* arcf_fieldfocus.cpp

  A 'bsdf' plugin that collects light from one side of a surface and sends it to the direction
  of the negative surface normal.

Run the  'patch-mutsuba.sh' script inside the toplevel directory of a Mitsuba checkout
to copy the source files to their correct locations, and to patch the SCons/CMake configuration
files to include the new plugins.
