        8.10.2. Direct illumination integrator (direct)

        Parameter               Type               Description
        shadingSamples          integer            This convenience parameter can be used to set both
                                                    emitterSamples and bsdfSamples at the same time.
        emitterSamples          integer            Optional more fine-grained parameter: specifies the number
                                                    of samples that should be generated using the direct
                                                    illumination strategies implemented by the scene’s emitters
                                                    (Default: set to the value of shadingSamples)
        bsdfSamples             integer            Optional more fine-grained parameter: specifies the num-
                                                    ber of samples that should be generated using the BSDF
                                                    sampling strategies implemented by the scene’s surfaces (De-
                                                    fault: set to the value of shadingSamples)
        strictNormals           boolean            Be strict about potential inconsistencies involving shading
                                                    normals? See page 154 for details. (Default: no, i.e. false)
        hideEmitters            boolean            Hide directly visible emitters? See page 149 for details.
                                                    (Default: no, i.e. false)

        This integrator implements a direct illumination technique that makes use of multiple importance
        sampling: for each pixel sample, the integrator generates a user-specifiable number of BSDF and
        emitter samples and combines them using the power heuristic. Usually, the BSDF sampling technique
        works very well on glossy objects but does badly everywhere else (Figure 33a), while the opposite is
        true for the emitter sampling technique (Figure 33b). By combining these approaches, one can obtain
        a rendering technique that works well in both cases (Figure 33c).

        The number of samples spent on either technique is configurable, hence it is also possible to turn
        this plugin into an emitter sampling-only or BSDF sampling-only integrator.

        For best results, combine the direct illumination integrator with the low-discrepancy sample
        generator (ldsampler). Generally, the number of pixel samples of the sample generator can be kept
        relatively low (e.g. sampleCount=4), whereas the shadingSamples parameter of this integrator
        should be increased until the variance in the output renderings is acceptable.

        Remarks:

        * This integrator does not handle participating media or indirect illumination.
